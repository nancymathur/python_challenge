# Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie - UO Bootcamp

## Background

 ## PyBank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

* In this homework challenge, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of the given company. I was given a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

* The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


## PyPoll

![Vote-Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)

* In this challenge, the task is to with help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. (Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be.)

* I was given a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
